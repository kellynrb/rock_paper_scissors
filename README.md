This is a game of rock, paper, scissors. There are 5 rounds. It uses DOM input text objects. A good exercise would be to rewrite it to take inputs using the prompt command.
The game is programmed to have 5 rounds whether or not the outcome is already determined. For example, if you won 3 times out of 3, you would still keep playing until 5 games
have finished, rather than ending the game there since the computer could not possibly win at that point. It could also be a good exercise to change the game to stop playing once
the outcome is determined, even before all 5 rounds have been played.
